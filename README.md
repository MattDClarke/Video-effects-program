# Video Effects Program

This Project makes use of the Chrome Face Detection API <https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5678216012365824>. It currently only works in Chrome. It requires the Experimental Web Platform features flag to be enabled (chrome://flags).

> This project is a mix of exercises from Wes Bos's Beginner JavaScript course and JavaScript30.
